\begin{abstract}
	This work is devoted to the development of a novel primal double-hybrid finite element formulation for the solution of tridimensional compressible, quasi-incompressible and incompressible elasticity problems. Hybrid-mixed methods are typically derived from an extended variational principle, where the requirement for the interlement continuity of the functions spaces is relaxed and weakly imposed using Lagrange multipliers over the element interfaces. In this sense, we propose the usage of a De Rham compatible pair H(div)-L2 for displacements and pressure, respectively. H(div) spaces naturally guarantees the continuity of the normal displacement across elements, so the tangential component conformity can be retrieved at the expense of introducing a shear stress approximation on the element edges. This leads to a semi-hybrid approach with two Lagrange multipliers so solving a saddle-point problem is inevitably even in the compreesible regime. To overcome this drawback, the shear stress can be further hybridized a second time and statically condensed to recover a positive-definite block matrix that depends on the primal variable components. In fact, there is still the need of solving a saddle point system when the bulk modulus tends to infinity, however, results have shown that this approach presents a superior stability compared to the semi-hybrid formulation. The stability, consistency and local conservation features are discussed in details. The formulation is tested and verified using 3D benchmarks for which analytical and/or numerical solutions are available, exhibiting optimal convergence rate independent of the poisson coefficient. The proposed methodology is also applied to a real-world problem, where the performance of the method is assessed in terms of accuracy and computational cost.

\section{Introduction}

Elasticity theory is fundamental in engineering, with applications spanning industries such as automotive, medicine, sports, construction, electronics, and biology \cite{banks2011brief, li2021topological, naddeo2021degradable, ferrari2022effect, sanfilippo2024revolutionising, mousavi2022experimental, weakley2022putting, mashaly2011evaluation, semnani2011advances, gosling2013analysis, edlund2009model, pan2023research, tian2024elastic, santos2025self, leonardi2024deeper}. Traditional  $H^1$-continuous Finite Element Method (FEM) formulations are known to work well for most problems with compressible materials. However, employing a continuous displacement approximation can introduce numerical issues, such as shear-locking due to spurious energy modes in bending \cite{bletzinger2000unified,belytschko1985stress} and volume locking in nearly or fully incompressible regimes, where stresses approach infinity \cite{neto2005f,cervera2003mixed}.

Various techniques have been developed to mitigate the shear-locking and problems with materials reaching the incompressibility limit. Examples of these techniques include: using reduced integration with hourglass control \cite{koh1987new, hutter2000total}, average nodal pressure formulations \cite{bonet1998simple, andrade2004assessment}, Weak Galerkin \cite{lin2018weak,wang2024lowest,harper2019lowest}, F-bar technique \cite{de1996design, neto2005f}, enhanced strain method \cite{lovadina2003enhanced, de1995remarks}, energy-sampling stabilization \cite{sivapuram2019energy, pakravan2017mean}, mixed formulations \cite{brezzi2012mixed,arnold1988new,taylor1973numerical}, and smoothed Finite Element Method \cite{lee2020linear, jiang2018sharp}. 

% The regularity of the solution to the Biot model can be used to indicate how displacement becomes divergence-free as Poisson's ratio approaches 0.5 \cite{yi2017study}. Using another scheme, a three-field formulation can be used to obtain symmetric saddle point problem expressed by a biorthogonal system of equations, which can be condensed to decrease the number of unknowns and generate locking-free approximations \cite{lamichhane2012symmetric, lamichhane2014mixed}. 

% {\nathan this paragraph is ok} Another class of algorithms for incompressible solids and structures has relied on Weak Galerkin (WG) approach. Using weak function and weak gradient, this method introduces degrees of freedom that allow discontinuous functions to be used as basis function \cite{lin2018weak}. On polygonal convex meshes, the lowest-order WG method employs piecewise constant vector-valued spaces on interior elements and edges \cite{wang2024lowest}. This approach is straightforward, effective, does not require stabilization, and leads to a symmetric positive-definite system. For meshes composed of rectangular or hexahedral elements, the lowest-order WG method is locking-free and achieves first-order accuracy in displacement, stress, and dilation \cite{harper2019lowest}.

One of the most widely adopted techniques is the mixed formulation \cite{brezzi2012mixed,arnold1988new} with Taylor-Hood elements \cite{taylor1973numerical}. In this approach, displacements and stresses (or pressure) are approximated independently, usually with $H^1$-continuous approximation spaces. The Taylor-Hood elements \cite{taylor1973numerical} satisfy the \textit{inf-sup} condition, ensuring stability in the incompressible regime. However, this formulation is not locally conservative, as it does not enforce the divergence constraint in a strong sense. 

The Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method has proved to be a viable approach to treat incompressibility. In combination with the Nitsche's approach -- which allows different approximations to be made in different elements, and the continuity of the solution is guaranteed through the interface between the elements -- DG shows optimal error estimates that are uniform with respect to Poisson's ratio for triangular and tetrahedra meshes \cite{hansbo2002discontinuous}. Since the DG method uses spaces of discontinuous basis functions, it enables high-order accuracy for generally-shaped mesh elements, simplifies the implementation of $hp$ adaptivity and parallelization \cite{gulizzi2023discontinuous, riviere2003discontinuous}, which is very attractive for massive computations. Hybridised versions (HDG) are also available, particularly suitable for problems with strong discontinuities (cracks) \cite{soon2009hybridizable}.

One viable alternative is to employ hybrid methods, where interelement continuity of a given field is relaxed and weakly enforced using Lagrange multipliers. This methodology was first proposed by \cite{raviart1977primal} to solve primal elasticity problems where the continuity requirement of the displacement field is weakly enforced on element boundaries through Lagrange multipliers that physically represent tractions. Since then, this idea has been widely explored in the literature \cite{brezzi2012mixed, harder2016hybrid, farhloul1997dual}. This technique has recently been applied to solve Stokes flow problems \cite{carvalho2024semi,puga2025stable} which can be shown to be similar to incompressible elasticity problems.

In this work we present an innovative approach able to solve compressible, near-incompressible and incompressible two- and three-dimensional elasticity problems. In the incompressible limit, the divergence-free condition is naturally satisfied. The formulation builds upon the semi-hybrid method proposed in \cite{carvalho2024semi} for Stokes flows, later extended to a double-hybrid approach in \cite{puga2025stable}. Here, we adapt it to elasticity by introducing a second hybridization on the tangential stresses. The method relies on a de Rham-compatible  $H(\text{div})-L^2$  pair for displacements and pressure, with $H(\text{div})$ functions systematically constructed using the methodology described in \cite{devloo2022efficient, de2013new}.


% Regardless of the greater or lesser robustness of the techniques mentioned above, most of them suffer from the same problem: they are not locally conservative as they do not satisfy the divergence constraint in a strong manner. To deal with that, some studies use hybrid methods where the interelement continuity of a given field is broken and weakly imposed by means of a Lagrange multiplier (see for instance \cite{raviart1977primal,harder2016hybrid,farhloul1997dual}).

Using a continuous Galerkin approach to approximate the displacements may lead to shear-locking phenomenon due to spurious energy modes under bending \cite{bletzinger2000unified,belytschko1985stress} or volume-locking under quasi or full incompressibility, as the stresses go to infinity \cite{neto2005f,cervera2003mixed}.
